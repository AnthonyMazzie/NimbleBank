This is a program that resembles a traditional bank.

Users can register and then once registered they can login to the system.

Authenticted users can check their balance, deposit, withdraw, retrieve account information, close account and log out.

Unauthenticated users are only allowed to either attempt to log in or register.

All bank information is stored in the login.txt file, and any updated information is stored outputFile.txt.
